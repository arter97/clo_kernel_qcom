       help
          This enables the watchdog framework for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
          devices. It causes a kernel panic if the watchdog times out. It allows
          for the detection of cpu hangs and deadlocks. It does not run during the
          bootup process, so it will not catch any early lockups. Enabling this

         This forces a watchdog bite early in panic sequence. On certain
         MSM SoCs, this provides us additional debugging information at the
         context of the crash. If this option is disabled, then bite occurs
         later in panic, which permits more of the restart sequence to run
         (e.g. more dmesg to flushed to console).
