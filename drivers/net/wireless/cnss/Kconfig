	help
	 This module adds support for the CNSS connectivity subsystem used
	 for wifi devices based on the QCA AR6320 chipset.
	 This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	 restart framework.

	help
	 This module adds support for the CNSS wlan module interfaced
	 with SDIO bus.
	 This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	 restart framework, power on WLAN chip and registered the WLAN module
	 as a SDIO client device.

config CNSS_MAC_BUG
	bool "Enable/disable 0-4K memory initialization for QCA6174"
	depends on CNSS
	help
	  If enabled, 0-4K memory is reserved for QCA6174 to address
	  a MAC HW bug. MAC would do an invalid pointer fetch based on
	  the data, that was read from 0 to 4K. So fill it with zero's;
	  to an address for which PCIe root complex would honor the read
	  without any errors.

config CLD_DEBUG
	bool "Enable/disable CLD debug features"
	help
	 WLAN CLD driver uses this config to enable certain debug features.
	 Some of the debug features may affect performance or may compromise
	 on security.

	  Say N, if you are building a release kernel for production use.
	  Only say Y, if you are building a kernel with debug support.
