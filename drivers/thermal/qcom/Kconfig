	 This enables a thermal driver for the MBG thermal monitoring device.
	 It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with two trip points.
	 It notifies the thermal framework when level 1 high threshold is
	 violated. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects

	  This enables a thermal sysfs driver for Qualcomm plug-and-play (QPNP)
	  PMIC devices. It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with multiple
	  trip points. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects the
	  real time die temperature if an ADC is present or an estimate of the

	  This enables initialization of Qualcomm limits management
	  hardware(LMh). LMh allows for hardware-enforced mitigation for cpus based on
	  input from temperature and current sensors.  On many newer Qualcomm SoCs
	  LMh is configured in the firmware and this feature need not be enabled.
	  However, on certain SoCs like sdm845 LMh has to be configured from kernel.
