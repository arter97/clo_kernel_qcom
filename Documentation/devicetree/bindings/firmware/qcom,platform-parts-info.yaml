title: QCOM Platform's Parts Information

description:
  Qualcomm platforms support a feature where a subset of hardware blocks
  like Camera, GPU, Display, Modem, CPUs are available in a product,
  based on features selected for a particular Stock keeping unit (SKU)
  and the same software images are supposed to work seamlessly with these.
  This is to support usecases where lets say a software image running on handset
  device which supports display and camera, can work just fine on another
  IoT product which doesn't need these. This also enables usecases, where certain
  sub parts for a HW block are not supported.

  Firmware reads the parts related information from lower layers and passes this
  information to kernel via this device tree interface, so that the respective
  clients are aware of it.
  For example, camera drivers and its user space daemons can use this interface
  to know if camera is not supported on the device or if a certain sub-feature inside
  camera is not supported.

  Firmware also reads SKU details and board information like memory card's serial
  number and populates it in new device tree nodes.

  serial-number:
    description:
      Serial number of the memory device used - UFS, NAND or EMMC. If none of them is found,
      this will return SoC's serial number.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  pcode:
    description:
      Product code used for the Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) for the device. If its not supported,
      value of the property is UINT32_MAX, i.e. all bits will be set.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  feature-code:
    description:
      Feature Code used for the Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) for the device. This has values like
      AA, AB, AC etc for external parts, and Y0, Y1, Y3 etc for internal parts. "Unknown" if SKU
      information is not supported for a platform.

  subset-cores:
    description:
      A bitmask value, encoded from LSB with a set bit corresponding to actual physical CPU
      not supported on the SoC.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  subset-parts:
    description:
      A bitmask value, encoded from LSB with a set bit corresponding to a particular part
      not supported on the SoC. Starting from LSB 1, parts correspond to GPU, Video, Camera,
      Display, Audio, Modem, WLAN, Compute, Sensors, NPU, SPSS, NAV, Compute1, Display1, NSP,
      EVA and PCIE.

      part-count:
        description:
          Number of instances available for a particular part type.
          If the value is UINT32_MAX, i.e. all bits set, then that value is invalid and not to be
          considered.

      part-info:
        description:
          Bitmap array with number of entries same as part-count. Each entry stores information
          related to subset of features/sub-parts supported for a particular instance of a part
          type. Each bitmask value, has its 0th bit set if that part is completely not supported.
          Otherwise, rest of the bits will correspond to specific functionalities
          of that part not supported.
          If the value is UINT32_MAX, i.e. all bits set, then that value is invalid and not to be
          considered.
