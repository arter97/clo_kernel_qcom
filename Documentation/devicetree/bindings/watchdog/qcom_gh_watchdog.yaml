description:
  Watchdog timer is configured with a bark and a bite time.
  If the watchdog is not "pet" at regular intervals, the system
  is assumed to have become non responsive and needs to be reset.
  A warning in the form of a bark timeout leads to a bark interrupt
  and a kernel panic. If the watchdog timer is still not reset,
  a bite timeout occurs, which leads to a reset of the VM via
  the hypervisor. The driver needs the petting time, and the bark
  timeout to be programmed into the watchdog, as well as the bark irq.
