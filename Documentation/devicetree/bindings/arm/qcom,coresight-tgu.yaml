title: Trigger Generation Unit - TGU

description: |
  The Trigger Generation Unit (TGU) is a Data Engine which can be utilized
  to sense a plurality of signals and create a trigger into the CTI or
  generate interrupts to processors. The TGU is like the trigger circuit
  of a Logic Analyzer. Once setup and enabled, it will ‘observe’ sense
  inputs and based upon the activity of those inputs, even over clock
  cycles, may detect a preprogrammed state/sequence and then produce a
  trigger or interrupt.

  The primary use case of the TGU is to detect patterns or sequences on a
  given set of signals within some region of the SoC.
