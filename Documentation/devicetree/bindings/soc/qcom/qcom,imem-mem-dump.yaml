description: |
  Memory dump region is which to provide hints(id and size) of
  debugging information based on specified protocols with firmware.
  Firmware then does the real data capture. The debugging information includes
  cache contents, internal memory, registers. After crash and warm reboot,
  firmware scans ids, sizes and stores contents into reserved memory accordingly.
  Firmware then enters into full dump mode which dumps whole DDR to PC through USB.
