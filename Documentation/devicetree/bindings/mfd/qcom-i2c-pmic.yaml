description: |
  The I2C PMIC Controller is used by multi-function PMIC devices which communicate
  over the I2C bus. An I2C PMIC controller node typically contains one or more
  child nodes representing the device's peripherals. Each of the peripherals
  typically has its own driver on the platform bus and will be enumerated by this
  controller. The controller exposes a regmap to the peripherals to communicate
  over the I2C bus.

  The controller also controls interrupts for all of the peripherals on the bus.
  The controller takes a summary interrupt, deciphers which peripheral triggered
  the interrupt, and which of the peripheral's interrupts were triggered. Finally,
  it calls the handlers for each of the virtual interrupts that were registered.
